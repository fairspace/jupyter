# A Helm chart for VRE workspaces
This helm chart will install and setup a single VRE workspace. It includes
an instance of JupyterHub.

Contains:
- JupyterHub with Python 3 and R kernels and JupyterLab extension
- Mercury
- Pluto
- Saturn

A workspace within Fairspace is always associated with a hyperspace. The
hyperspace contains shared components, such as Keycloak for authentication.
The connection to the hyperspace should be configured when installing this chart.

## Prerequisites

Install [the Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install), ensure
that your Google account has access to the fairspace-207108 GCP project,
log in using `gcloud auth login`, and configure Docker for access to the GCP
registries using `gcloud auth configure-docker`.

## How to install

### On GCP/GKE

First create a configuration file with settings for the workspace to install. For example:

```yaml
hyperspace:
    domain: hyperspace.ci.test.fairdev.app
    keycloak:
        username: keycloak
        password: abcdefghi
        realm: hyperspace

workspace:
    testuser:
        password: secret-password

jupyterhub:
    proxy:
        secretToken: 3fca8159e7e0c07db4f6601799d961e82836965bf2b5d7a4310b7686cb18762e
        
pluto:
    keycloak:
        baseUrl: https://keycloak.hyperspace.ci.test.fairdev.app
        realm: hyperspace     

```

Then use the procedure at <https://wiki.thehyve.nl/display/VRE/Deploying+Fairspace+on+GCP>
for deploying the application.

### On Minikube

By default, on minikube one would want to run the system without TLS and ingresses. An example
configuration file would be something like:

```yaml
# Provide your own hyperspace settings here
hyperspace:
    tls: false
    locationOverrides:
        keycloak: http://192.168.99.100:30867
    keycloak:
        username: keycloak
        password: abcdefghi
        realm: hyperspace

workspace:
    ingress:
        enabled: false

pluto:
    service:
        type: NodePort
    keycloak:
        # Provide your own keycloak settings here
        baseUrl: http://192.168.99.100:30867
        realm: hyperspace
```

We currently don't have a tested script for Minikube deployments. The steps should largely be
the same as the ones for GCP, except for configuration of GCP-specific resources, and cert-manager
installation.

#### Workspace parameters
| Parameter  | Description  | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `nameOverride`  | Unique name for the workspace to install. Please note that if you override the name, also set `pluto.workspace.name` | <release name> |
| `workspace.testuser.username`  | Username for the testuser that will be created for this workspace | `test-<workspace_name>` |
| `workspace.testuser.password`  | Password for the testuser for this workspace | `fairspace123` |
| `workspace.ingress.enabled`  | Whether or not an ingress is setup for the workspace components. Should be set to false when running locally.  | true |
| `workspace.ingress.domain`   | Domain that is used for setting up the workspace. Is used as postfix for the hostname for the specific components. For example setting `fairspace.app` as domain will setup jupyterhub at `jupyterhub.fairspace.app`  | workspace.ci.test.fairdev.app  |
| `workspace.ingress.tls.enabled`  | Whether or not an TLS is enabled on the ingresses for workspace  | true  |
| `workspace.ingress.tls.secretNameOverride`  | If set, this secret name is used for loading certificates for TLS. | `tls-<release name>` |
| `workspace.ingress.tls.certificate.obtain`  | If set, a `Certificate` object will be created, such that [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) will request a certificate automatically. | true |
| `workspace.keycloak.roles.user` | Role that the user must have if he wants to login to this workspace. | `user-<workspace-name>` |
| `workspace.keycloak.roles.datasteward` | Role that the user must have if he wants to manage the vocabulary. | `datasteward-<workspace-name>` |
| `workspace.keycloak.groups.user` | Members of this group will show up in the collaborator dropdown. These users normally always have the required authority to login. | `<workspace-name>-users` |

#### Hyperspace parameters
| Parameter  | Description  | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `hyperspace.tls`  | Whether or not the hyperspace uses tls. Is used for automatic creation of hyperspace urls | true |
| `hyperspace.domain` | Domain that is used for the hyperspace. Should only include the domain postfix, that was used when installing the hyperspace. Is used as postfix for the hostname for the specific components. For example setting `hyperspace.fairspace.app` as domain will try to lookup keycloak at `keycloak.hyperspace.fairspace.app`  | hyperspace.ci.test.fairdev.app  |
| `hyperspace.locationOverrides.keycloak` | Optional override for the location of keycloak. Can be used if it runs on a non-standard location. Must include the scheme as well. For example: `http://192.168.99.100:30867` | (Generate url from `hyperspace.domain` property) |
| `hyperspace.keycloak.username`  | Username used for setting up keycloak users. Must have access to the master realm | |
| `hyperspace.keycloak.password`  | Password used for setting up keycloak users. | |
| `hyperspace.keycloak.realm`  | Keycloak realm that is used for this hyperspace. Also set this variable in `pluto.keycloak.realm`| |
| `hyperspace.keycloak.clientSecret`  | UUID that is used as client secret in communication between pluto and keycloak.| <random uuid> |

#### Pluto parameters
| Parameter  | Description  | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `pluto.keycloak.baseUrl` | Base url of the keycloak installation, with scheme, without /auth. For example: `https://keycloak.hyperspace.fairspace.app`  |   |
| `pluto.keycloak.realm`   | Keycloak realm that is used for this hyperspace.  |   |
| `pluto.keycloak.redirectAfterLogoutUrl`   | URL to redirect the user to after logging out  |   |

#### Tool configuration
Configuration settings for specific applications should be put under a corresponding section in config.yaml:

* Jupyterhub
Settings for Jupyterhub should be in the section `jupyterhub`.
See [the Jupyterhub docs](http://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-environment.html) for more information on the specific settings

* Pluto
Settings for Pluto should be in the section `pluto`.
See [the Pluto README](https://github.com/fairspace/workspace/blob/dev/projects/pluto/README.md) for more information on the specific settings

* Mercury
Settings for Mercury should be in the section `mercury`.
See [the Mercury README](https://github.com/fairspace/workspace/blob/dev/projects/mercury/README.md) for more information on the specific settings

## Image pull secrets
When pulling docker images from a private repository, k8s needs credentials to do so. This can be configured using [image pull secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry).
To use the secret for installing a workspace, follow these steps:
- [Create a image pull secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/#create-a-secret-in-the-cluster-that-holds-your-authorization-token) with the credentials to login. Please note
  that this secret is bound to a namespace, and as such should be added to each namespace separately.
- Specify the image pull secret as follows for fairspace services:
    ```yaml
      imagePullSecrets:
      - name: <secret-name>
    ```
    This configuration should be added for each fairspace service (mercury, pluto, saturn), so for example:
    ```yaml
      mercury:
        imagePullSecrets:
        - name: <secret-name>
    ```
- Add [credentials for jupyterhub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s/blob/master/jupyterhub/values.yaml#L55) separately:
  ```yaml
    jupyterhub:
      hub:
        imagePullSecret:
          enabled: true
          registry: eu.gcr.io
          username: ...
          email: ...
          password: ...
      singleuser:
        imagePullSecret:
          enabled: true
          registry: eu.gcr.io
          username: ...
          email: ...
          password: ...
  ```
  Please note that the version of the Jupyterhub helm chart currently in use (0.7) does not allow for setting the imagePullSecret for the
  `hub`. That has to be set manually.

## Upgrading installations
Please note that some values in the chart have a random default. These work fine on first installation, but may break upgrades
of the chart, as the random values may be computed again.

Other properties may contain default values, which is not advised to use. For those reasons it is strongly advised to define
values for at least the following properties:

* `hyperspace.keycloak.password`
* `hyperspace.keycloak.clientSecret`
